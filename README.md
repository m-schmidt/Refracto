Refracto - Refractometer Calculator for Homebrewers
===================================================

[*Refracto*](https://m-schmidt.github.io/Refracto) is a tool for homebrewers that will help you to convert your refractometer measurements during a fermentation process from °Brix to SG or °Plato. It automatically compensates the alcohol effect during fermentation.

Refracto is available on the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id954981822)

## How to use Refracto

1. Swipe vertically to enter your initial refractometer reading, i.e. the measurement result for the original wort, just before adding the yeast.
2. Swipe vertically to enter your current refractometer reading, i.e. a measurement result after the fermentation process has started.
3. Swipe horizontally to switch between the computation modes. Available modes are the *Standard* formula according *Louis* *K.* *Bonham*, the *quadratic* and *linear* formula of *Petr* *Novotný*, and the *cubic* and *linear* formulas of *Sean* *Terrill*. The *Standard* and *Novotný* formulas are recommended for general purpose use.
4. You are done! In the upper section you can now see the computed values for your beer.

## Computed Values

*Refracto* computes and immediately updates the following values whenever you change one of its input values:

1. The resulting *original gravity* (OG) and *apparent final gravity* (FG) in °Plato.
2. The resulting *original gravity* (OG) and *apparent final gravity* (FG) in SG.
3. The amount of sugars consumed by the yeast so far, displayed as *apparent attenuation* on the top and the estimated *alcohol* content as percent by volume on the bottom.
